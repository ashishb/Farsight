For the rest of the semeter, we will focus on the following work,
all of which have a common goal of further improving the generalization
accuracy.
\begin{itemize}
\item We will take our processed data with spell correction and bigrams
and retry some of the more expensive learning algorithms. In particular
we believe that by tuning the nu-SVM algorithm we should be able to
get substantially better results than what we currently have.
\item After having settled on an algorithm, which we believe will be nu-SVM,
we will play around with k-fold cross-verification to see whether
we can further improve the results.
\item We will try out other data processing techniques as we think of them.
One potential idea is to replace all adjectives with a common synonym
with the hope of further consolidating signals.\end{itemize}
