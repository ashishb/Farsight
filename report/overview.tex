To solve this problem, first we evaluated a number of learning algorithms
such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM on the original
raw data as-is to get a sense of their feasibility, capability, and
speed. Then we developed our own pre-processing pipeline to transform
the original data to better emphasize sentimental features, which
we evaluated with one of the learning algorithms.

Having developed a good pipeline for pre-processing the data, our
next step will be to revisit the learning algorithms and tune them
to achieve even better results.
