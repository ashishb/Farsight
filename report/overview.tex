To solve this problem\cite{Qu:2010:BMR:1873781.1873884,li2010}, first
we evaluated a number of learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression,
Naive Bayes, and SVM on the original raw data as-is to get a sense
of their feasibility, capability, and speed. Then we developed our
own pre-processing pipeline to transform the original data to better
emphasize sentimental features, which we evaluated with one of the
learning algorithms. 

Based on our analysis, we removed several redundant and noisy features
to further improve the accuracy of our pipeline.
